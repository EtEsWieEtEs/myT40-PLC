# myT40-PLC  (SPS) based on Teensy 4.0
Hardware for PLC based on Teensy 4.0, covering all my needs. I have to replace my 25 years old PS4-141-MM1 and PS4-341-MM1 from Kl√∂cker Moeller, reusing the original case of the model PS4-141-MM1.

For better return paths of capacitively coupled signals to related ground on additional layers I created a 4-layers version for Upper PCB "OP". The lower PCB is designed as 2-layer board.

Attended documents describe the "Final Version V4" as "V2.9_M41", based on experience of 4 prototypes build up in the past 4 years.

Current developement:
---------------------
In the meantime I build up the Final version 4 as M38, but I found some more errors. See pictures.
One error I found was, that some input pins on Teensy 4.0 have a lower input resistance as expencted, and that leads to the effect, that a pull-up resistor does not lift the resultig level over 2.1V, which is needed by the OR-gate to trigger the NE555 for power-on.
The combination R126/R128 to provide 3.2V for pull-up SW_MODE_2 was substituted by R126=220Ohm a direct connection to 3.3V from lower board.
Additionally the OR-gate was changed to a level shift variant for translation 3.3V to 5V signaling.
An other effect causes an voltage edge down on 5V power line during power-up Teensy4.0 that leeds to a RESET trigger by U48 (reset generator 5V). Therefore U48 and C1 were eliminated.
Now it is working and I provide the actualized description for the very very final Version as V2.9 M41.

There are some things to do, e.g. external Hardware watchdog or translation of documentation into English or Spanish. Perhaps in winter.
So feel free and be inspired.
