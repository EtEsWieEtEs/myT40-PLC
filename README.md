# myT40-PLC  (SPS) based on Teensy 4.0
Hardware for PLC based on Teensy 4.0, covering all my needs I have to be able to replace my 25 years old PS4-141-MM1 and PS4-341-MM1 from Kl√∂cker Moeller, reusing the original case of model PS4-141-MM1.
DIN-5 connectors and extension slot are incomatible to the origin.

For lower frequencies and lower budget, standard PCB has 2 layers. 
For better return paths of capacitively coupled signals to related ground on additional layers I created a 4-layers version for Upper PCB "OP".
The final version of upper pcb (OP) will provided in 4 layers only due to a better stability.


Current developement:
---------------------
In the meantime I build up the Final version 4 as M38, but I found some more errors.
One error I found was, that some input pins on Teensy 4.0 have a lower input resistance as expencted, and that leads to the effect, that a pull-up resistor does not lift the resultig level over 2.1V, which is needed by the OR-gate to trigger the NE555 for power-on.

The combination R126/R128 to provide 3.2V for pull-up SW_MODE_2 was substituted by R126=220Ohm and R128 by zener diode 3.0V. 

Additionalle the OR-gate was changed to a level shift variant for translation 3.3V to 5V signaling.

An other effect causes an edge down on 5V power line during power-up Teensy4.0 that leeds to a RESET trigger by U48 (reset generator 5V). Therefore U48 and C1 were eliminated.

You find the pictures of prototypes V2,V3 and V4, the lather one labled as M38 with corrections is labled now as M40.

Now it is working and I will provide an actualized description for the very very final Version as V2.9 M41 in the next time.
