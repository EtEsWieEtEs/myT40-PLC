Two versions provided:
- 2-Layer	PCB for OP (upper board)
- 4-Layer PCB for OP (upper board)
	
4-Layer PCB for OP provides return paths for capacitively coupled signals to related ground on additional layers.
UP (second/lower board) remains on 2-Layer PCB for both variants of OP.
	
See www  for "Power Plane and Ground Planes: Should You Use Your PCB Power Plane as a Return Path?"

My 4 layers for OP

	TOP: signal + PE
	
	In1: different ground
	
	In2: different ground + some power
	
	BOT: signal + PE
