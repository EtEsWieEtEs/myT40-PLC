You see here myT40-PLC and a modified 16 channel digital IO fitted to myT40-PLC.

- myT40-PLC V4 below mounted in open original case,
- top part of original case in the middle,
- removed original innards on top

I did not mount the parts for ADC nor DAC, because I won't used it in the role as master-PLC for my home automation project.
